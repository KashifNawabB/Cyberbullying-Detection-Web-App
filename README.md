# Cyberbullying-Detection-Web-App
Cyberbullying detection web app developed in Python Django 
Machine Learning based Django web app developed as part of my MSc Cyber Seucrity Dissertation, which
detects hate speech and bullying content in audio, video and text using trained ML model. REST APIs fetch
data from frontend to backend, where the content is processed using ML model, and responce is returned to
frontend. These APIs can be embedded to any social media plateform to detect and prevent Cyberbullying.
